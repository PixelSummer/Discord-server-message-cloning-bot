# Discord-server-message-cloning-bot
A Python bot using discord.py to copy messages, media, and links from one Discord server to another. It supports resuming from the last processed message, converts timestamps to UTC+1, handles Tenor links, and manages large file attachments by sending links instead of skipping them.
